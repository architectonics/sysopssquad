**Sysops Squad Architecture**
Add description of Sysops Context Diagram Here

**C4 Diagrams** 
Our team chose to try the [C4 Model](c4model.com) approach to diagrams.  This page has the context diagram, and the next diagrams are the container diagrams.  We expect to collaborate with the developers on the Component level diagrams as we get closer to implementation.

**Architecture as Code**
We decided to implement our diagrams as text files, enabling us to comment on individual lines in the pull requests and to collaborate better than if we were committing rendered images.

**Contributing** 
This is an active work in progress, and we'd encourage your input.  Please find the instructions on how to contribute [here](https://github.com/architectonics/sysopssquad/blob/main/contribute.md)..
