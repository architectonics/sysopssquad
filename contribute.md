## Getting Started

We utilize a few Javascript libraries and VS Code Extensions that make development of Architecture Diagrams easy, and fun.  Once you clone the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/architectonics/sysopssquad

You'll want to run the command to install the NPM dependencies:

    npm install

Give it a few minutes to download a few dependencies, then run:

    npm start

in order to build and start the documentation in the dev webserver, which should now be running at:  http://localhost:3000

## Contributions

Please create a github fork of the repository, and submit any pull requests.  Because the images are just text files, using traditional git workflows works great for both major refactoring and minor enhancements to the images.
